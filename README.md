# Game-Predictions-
Using Houston Astros 2017 season stats to figure out what stats are important to winning WS, and if the model can help predict a winner of two randomly drafted teams of historical and current MLB stars. 
Going to use a general linear regression model. The goal is to formulate a model from MLB stats during a 162 game season that can best predict average runs per game. 
With this model I can plug in stats and estimate who would win, via runs per game, between chosen lineups with players current and historical. 
Take all stats from MLB in 2017 and find out average runs per game and what variable(s) (different stats) that correlates most significantly to runs scored per game.
